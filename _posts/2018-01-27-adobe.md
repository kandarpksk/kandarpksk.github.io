My internship at Adobe Technology Labs, Bangalore, was in an open-ended role wherein the mentor and a team of three worked on a mutually-chosen topic related to Business Intelligence and Campaign Design. We analyzed abandonment of shopping carts to classify site visitors based on likelihood to buy. Also, their propensity to unsubscribe from related e-commerce email campaigns was evaluated. We filed two US patents titled '*Online Shopping Cart Analysis*' and '*Predicting Unsubscription of Potential Customers*'.

[//]: # talk about rosy steps of creating a visualization
[//]: # visualizing site visitors' tendencies for real-time targeting

My unique contribution was visualizing both tendencies in conjunction, to make possible better targeting customers of e-commerce sites in real time, potentially by pushing offers based on customer characteristics. Shown below is a screen capture of the stock D3.js visualization, which was heavily adapted for the purposes described shortly.

The **size** of the bubbles indicated the number of **items in the cart** of a potential customer. The Adobe colour scheme was used, with **colors** indicating the **predictions**.
A **bubble** would stay on screen, moving from left to right, based on the length of the **browsing session**. Each bubble could be **clicked** to see specific **customer information**.

Please see my mentor (from Adobe Research Labs) describing an extension of our ideas in the section titled "Ad Wearout" (http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2016/03/summit-sneaks-you-have-to-see.html). The underlying concept (in terms of data science) has evolved, however, the visualization I created is still relevant in both structure and aesthetic. In this case, the marketer is the user, and integration into her workflow and uniformity with the rest of the analytics dashboard are the factors that remain consistent and hence integral to my design.
