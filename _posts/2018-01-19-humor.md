Computational humor is the problem of generating, identifying and maybe even responding to humorous situations. It lies in the AI-complete category of problems, meaning that if it is solved, computers can be said to be as intelligent as humans. The talk begins by summarizing existing theories of humor and their associated mathematical models. Then, we[^1] survey a paper that uses machine learning to classify text fragments as humorous or not. Next in line is a paper that algorithmically generates knock-knock jokes. Finally, we look at a paper that constructs pairs of graphs in order to generate conversational humor.
