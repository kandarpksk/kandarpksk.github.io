I am a graduate student working with [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net) in the Design Lab at UC San Diego to envision and build systems to help people design and program effectively, at scale.

<!-- My research is focused on building user-centered systems to help people design and code effectively, with scalability in mind. -->
Here is a quick overview of (the different areas of) my work:
- [Codemotion](codemotion): reimagining interactions with programming tutorial screencasts to make them easier to find, navigate and practice with, by extracting source code edits from videos.
- Error messages: augmenting the coding-debugging workflow with learning aids when a programmer is stuck and needs help -- among the ways is adapting ELIZA (a chatbot that mimics a psychotherapist) to aid self-reflection.
- Design: enabling user testing with frontend-only web prototypes, by helping a facilitator imitate backend logic and present new interface elements in real time.
