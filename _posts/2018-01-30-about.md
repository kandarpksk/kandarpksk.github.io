I will be a part of the UX group at MathWorks soon (details to follow). As a graduate student, I worked with [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net) in the Design Lab at UC San Diego, to create user-centered systems to enable people to program effectively, at scale.

Here is an outline of (the different areas of) my work:
- **Video interactions**: reimagining interfaces to make programming tutorial screencasts easier to find, navigate and practice with, by extracting source code edits from the raw videos.
- **Error messages**: augmenting the coding-debugging workflow with learning aids when a programmer is stuck and needs help -- among the ways is adapting ELIZA (a chatbot that mimics a psychotherapist) to aid self-reflection.
- **Chatbots**: evaluating the design of a conversational agent for augmenting learn-to-code UIs in place of live help.
- **Permissions**: designing a new model for Android apps that prevents misuse of permissions while reducing interruptions to the user.
