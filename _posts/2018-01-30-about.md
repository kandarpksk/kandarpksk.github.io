I am a graduate student working with [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net) in the Design Lab at UC San Diego, to create user-centered systems to help people program and design effectively at scale.

Here is a quick overview of (the different areas of) my work:
- **Video interactions**: reimagining interfaces to make programming tutorial screencasts easier to find, navigate and practice with, by extracting source code edits from the raw videos.
- **Error messages**: augmenting the coding-debugging workflow with learning aids when a programmer is stuck and needs help -- among the ways is adapting ELIZA (a chatbot that mimics a psychotherapist) to aid self-reflection.
- **Wizard-of-Oz**: enabling user testing with frontend-only web prototypes, by helping a facilitator imitate backend logic and present new interface elements in real time.
