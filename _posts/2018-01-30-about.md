I am a graduate student working with [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net) in the Design Lab at UC San Diego to envision and build systems to help people design and program effectively, at scale. <!-- I firmly believe that advancement in technology is at a stage where anything we might want to dream about is [within the realm of possibility](https://www.microsoft.com/buxtoncollection "please see the quote") as long as we are persistent. -->

<!-- *<span style="text-align: center;">❝my work is around devising interactions inaccessible to those not experienced enough to get their hands dirty and tinker with with different levels of technology stacks❞</span>* -->

<!-- My design process is predominantly user-centric, with emphasis on whether there is a real need for the system I envision and later build. I try to recreate the target user's mental model and link breakdowns to the underlying technology to come up with meaningful and practical solutions.
Also, my perspective is to adapt to the requirements of the solution that I (or my team) decide to build, rather than narrowing the range of the solution space explored in the first place. -->

My research is focused on building scalable, user-centered systems to help people design and code effectively. Here is a quick overview of (the different areas of) my work:
- [Codemotion](codemotion): reimagining interactions with programming tutorial screencasts to make them easier to find, navigate and practice with, by extracting source code edits from videos.
- Making error messages great: augmenting the coding-debugging workflow with learning aids when a programmer is stuck and needs help -- among the ways is adapting ELIZA (a chatbot that mimics a psychotherapist) to aid self-reflection.
- An idea currently in my buffer but one that I'd like the oppotunity to explore: enabling user testing with front-end-only prototypes, by helping a facilitator imitate (Wizard-of-Oz, or WOz) backend logic in real time.
