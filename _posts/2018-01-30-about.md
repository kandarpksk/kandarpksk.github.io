I am a part of the UX group at MathWorks. I design and usability-test new features in MATLAB with cross-functional teams. As a graduate student, I worked with [Prof. Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net) in the Design Lab at UC San Diego, to create scalable user-centered systems to help people learn and do programming.
Here is an outline of the different areas of my work:
- **Video interactions**: reimagining interfaces to make programming tutorial screencasts easier to find, navigate and practice with, by extracting source code edits from the raw videos.
- **Error messages**: augmenting the coding-debugging workflow with learning aids when a programmer is stuck and needs help -- among the ways is adapting ELIZA (a chatbot that mimics a psychotherapist) to aid self-reflection.
- **Chatbots**: evaluating the design of a conversational agent for augmenting learn-to-code UIs in place of live help.
- **Permissions**: designing a new model for Android apps that prevents misuse of permissions while reducing interruptions to the user.
