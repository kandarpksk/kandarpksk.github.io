I was a UX Research intern at Google, where I was mentored by Tao Dong in the Flutter team. I substantially improved the usability of error messages by means of interviews with stakeholders, applications of visual design techniques in prototyping, online surveys (to do an unmoderated usability study!) and quantitative analysis. Here's a grid of the variations of an error message that I created:

We published an extended abstract at CHI 2019 discussing some of our work. Watch a 30-second summary below! ([link to paper](/files/error-messages-chi2019-khandwala.pdf))
