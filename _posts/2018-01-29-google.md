Last summer, I was a UX Research intern at Google, where I worked with *[Tao Dong](https://www.taodong.net)* in the [Flutter](https://flutter.io) team on the topic of usability of error messages by means of interviews with stakeholders, applications of visual design techniques in prototyping, surveys (using Qualtrics) and quantitative analysis. We submitted an extended abstract to CHI 2019 discussing some of our work, that you can preview [here](/files/error-messages-chi2019-khandwala.pdf).
