As a UX Research intern at Google, I substantially improved the usability of error messages in Flutter by means of interviews with stakeholders, applications of visual design techniques in prototyping, online surveys (to do an unmoderated usability study!) and quantitative analysis.
The picture above shows three visual variations I created of an example error message.

I was mentored by Tao Dong, and we published an extended abstract at CHI 2019 ([link to paper](/files/error-messages-chi2019-khandwala.pdf)) discussing some of the work. Watch a 30-second summary below!
