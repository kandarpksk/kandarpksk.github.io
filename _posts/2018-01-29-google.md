I was a UX Research intern at Google, where I worked with [Tao Dong](https://www.taodong.net) in the [Flutter](https://flutter.io) team on the topic of usability of error messages by means of interviews with stakeholders, applications of visual design techniques in prototyping, online surveys and quantitative analysis. We published an extended abstract at CHI 2019 discussing some of our work. ([link to paper](/files/error-messages-chi2019-khandwala.pdf))
