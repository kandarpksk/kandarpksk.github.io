Last summer, I was a UX Research intern at Google, where I worked with *[Tao Dong](https://www.taodong.net)* in the [Flutter](https://flutter.io) team on the topic of usability of error messages by means of interviews with stakeholders, applications of visual design techniques in prototyping, surveys (using Qualtrics) and quantitative analysis.
