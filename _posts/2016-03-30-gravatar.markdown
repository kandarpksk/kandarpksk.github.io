Having seen or tried out many different apps that "handle" contacts on Android, including iterations of Google's stock solution that comes with the default dialer (they really don't seem to settle on a design), a more telling question comes to mind.

**There's nothing that ensures you never lose someone's contact information.** A "contact" is characterized by the contact information such as email or phone number, rather than by, say, an *internet identity* of the person. A person much inform all others about any changed information (and everyone must individually update it in their "books").

Before fixing it, there are two questions to be addressed. Is there a way to avoid having a centralized authority (the equivalent of a phonebook publisher) which can be compromised? Also, how much control over what information (or subsequent updates) is shared can be had?

*Work in progress.*
