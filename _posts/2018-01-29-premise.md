<!-- what, how and why I think as I do -->

I am a third year PhD student at UC San Diego in Computer Science. I work with Philip Guo to envision and build systems to help people design and program effectively, at scale.

I firmly believe that advancement in technology is currently "good enough" that anything we might want to dream of, is possible to a reasonable extent as long as we are persistent.
In the sphere of interactions with computing interfaces, let's consider YouTube-esque web video players: one-size-fits-all solutions that doesn’t cater to programming videos.
[extracting code from a video is tedious and inefficient, with no scope for end-users to dabble]
Similarly, we have proxies, but they cater to low-level stuff (with security being an inevitable distraction) rather that say, live testing of designs.
Thus, so far, my work has to do with creating affordances for interactions that are foreseeable but inaccessible to those not experienced enough to get their hands dirty with different levels of technology stacks.

My research is towards building scalable, user-centered systems to help people design and code effectively. Here is a quick overview of the different areas of my work:
• Reimagining interactions with programming tutorial screencasts to make them easier to find, navigate and practice with, by extracting source code edits from videos.
• Augmenting the coding-debugging workflow with a learning angle when a programmer is stuck and needs help -- among the ways considered is adapting ELIZA (a chatbot that mimics a psychotherapist) to aid self-reflection.
• Enabling user testing with front-end-only prototypes, by helping a facilitator imitate (wizard-of-oz) backend logic in real-time.

My design process is predominantly user-centric, with repeated emphasis on whether there is a real need for the system I envision and later build. I try to recreate the target user's mental model and link breakdowns to the underlying technology to come up with meaningful and practical solutions. Also, my perspective is to adapt to the requirements of the solution that I (or my team) decide to build, rather than narrowing the range of the solution space explored in the first place.

	Please see my mentor (from Adobe Research Labs) describing an extension of our ideas in the section titled "Ad Wearout" (http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2016/03/summit-sneaks-you-have-to-see.html). The underlying concept (in terms of data science) has evolved, however, the visualization I created is still relevant in both structure and aesthetic. In this case, the marketer is the user, and integration into her workflow and uniformity with the rest of the analytics dashboard are the factors that remain consistent and hence integral to my design.

It is my hope that some of the work I do during the course of my Ph.D. will remain out there in the real world, and an internship involving work that will eventually be user-facing, not necessarily in a tangible manner, will be most satisfying (since it's early days, however, this is not a hard requirement).
