<div align="justify">The embedded video shows a frame-by-frame translation of gameplay (<a href="http://johanneskopf.de/publications/pixelart/supplementary/video_hq4x_4x_h264.mp4">source</a>) from Mario into the corresponding Voronoi diagrams. This was part of an attempt to implement Kopf and Lischinski's SIGGRAPH'11 paper 'Depixelizing Pixel Art' in a team of two. Code available on <a href="https://github.com/kandarpksk">GitHub</a>.</div><br/>

PS: Notice the reduced blockiness (since the algorithm infers shape) when Mario is on top of Yoshi. The video is a bit blurry due to YouTube's compression, but it's still an improvement over the original!
