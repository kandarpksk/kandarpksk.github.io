The seminar begin by summarizing existing theories of humour and their associated mathematical models. Then, we<sup>1</sup> survey a paper that uses machine learning to classify text fragments as humourous or not, followed by a paper that algorithmically generates knock-knock jokes (you read it right!), and finally a paper that constructs pairs of graphs in order to generate conversational jokes.</div>

<div align="justify"><sup>1</sup> This was presented as a seminar for an Artificial Intelligence course, in a team of three in my junior year. It was well received, with Professor Bhattacharya (now Director, IIT Patna) commenting, <i>"Foundation, technique, recent advances - all aspects were dealt with with aplomb and insight. A model seminar, no doubt."</i></div>
