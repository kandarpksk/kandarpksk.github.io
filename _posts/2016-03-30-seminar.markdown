title: "A seminar on Computational Humour"
permalink: /computational-humour
---

Computational humour is the problem of generating, identifying and maybe even responding to humourous situations. It lies in the AI-complete category of problems, meaning that if it is solved, computers can be said to be as intelligent as humans.

The seminar begin by summarizing existing theories of humour and their associated mathematical models. Then, we<sup>1</sup> survey a paper that uses machine learning to classify text fragments as humourous or not, followed by a paper that algorithmically generates knock-knock jokes (you read it right!), and finally a paper that constructs pairs of graphs in order to generate conversational jokes.
