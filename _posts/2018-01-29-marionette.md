Have you ever done tested a prototype and heard (or as a facilitator, said) any of these expressions: *just assume it's x*, or *we haven't built it*, or *that case is yet to be handled*? Invision-like prototypes are great, but they're not only separated from the production front-end, but also cannot perform simple functionality like that of a calculator. In this project, I'm trying to create a transformation for any app to be turned into a marionette, that can be tweaked live to conduct user studies.

but say there's a nutrition app with a branch of decision-making...
it's far easier to just have a human behind the scenes -->
