TODO

Have you ever done tested -- either as a facilitator or a user -- a prototype and said (or heard) the expressions *just assume it's x*, or *we haven't built it*, or *that case is yet to be handled*?
<!-- plus, this absolutely doesn't work when you have to experience the technology for an authentic reaction -->

Invision-like prototypes are great, but they're not only separated from the production front-end but also cannot illustrate simple functionality like that of a calculator.

	in this case, coding is better;
	but say there's a nutrition app with a branch of decision-making...
	it's far easier to just have a human behind the scenes
