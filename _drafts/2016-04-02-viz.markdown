I wish to recreate the visualizations for the purpose of my portfolio, but don't recall the descriptions of the bubbles, i.e. what the size/speed/color mean (and I believe there was some text on clicking).

Size was number of products in the cart

I didn't think colour meant any thing

Speed was based on length of the session

By clicking you could see the session

I actually (probably) remember the color coding now: it was the prediction whether the customer will buy or not.
