title: "marionette: enabling dynamic exploratory user studies with higher fidelity prototypes"
permalink: /marionette

High-fidelity prototypes/sketches are not great for testing interactions that depend on user inputs, while coded prototypes require a backend, which may be premature in the design and development cycle. We pose the following question to create a new middle ground: What if it was easy for “non-developers” to manipulate a purely front-end prototype in real time? To explore this question, we built a framework called Marionette (“puppet worked by strings”) that allows any web site/app to be dynamically adapted by a facilitator in a user study — even a simple collection of static web pages can be made to appear as a fluid workflow for a more realistic experience. To make it possible for the facilitator to make changes effectively, we created a UI supporting drag-and-drop addition of both predefined and generic widgets. In addition, we also leverage the developer tools to allow low-level modifications. An exploratory study with 10 design teams will inform us about the benefits of keeping the illusion alive in this novel stage of design/development.

(work in progress)

<!-- Have you ever done tested a prototype and heard (or as a facilitator, said) any of these expressions: *just assume it's x*, or *we haven't built it*, or *that case is yet to be handled*? Invision-like prototypes are great, but they're not only separated from the production front-end, but also cannot perform simple functionality like that of a calculator. In this project, I'm trying to create a transformation for any app to be turned into a marionette, that can be tweaked live to conduct user studies. -->

<!-- /tab/ in this case, coding is better;
but say there's a nutrition app with a branch of decision-making...
it's far easier to just have a human behind the scenes -->
